# Rust - Flood It

This is a Rust implementation of the Flood It game.

# TODO

- [ ] Optimize game rendering by storing the rects
- [ ] HUD
- [ ] Implement graphs
- [ ] add a probability coefficient that will produce difficulty (e.g. 75% chances that a case has
      the same color of one of its neighbors for example)
